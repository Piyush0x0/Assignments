        "- Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line using an interpreter, resulting in slower execution but allowing for immediate feedback (e.g., Python, JavaScript).  \n",
        "- Compiled languages convert code into machine code before execution, resulting in faster runtime but requiring a separate compilation step (e.g., C, C++).\n",

        "\n",
        "**3. What is the purpose of the `finally` block in exception handling?**  \n",
